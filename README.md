A Dero Universal Wallet with mobile UI.
Cross-platform: Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android, IOS...

## Why

The Dero Project already has a fantastic wallet made by the foundation members,
but I want to offer an alternative with a different UI and other features.
The most notable difference in technology is that this wallet uses Gio UI instead of Fyne for rendering components.

## Features

- Integrated fast-sync Dero Node for full privacy.
- Connect to a remote node for swift utilization.
- Multiple wallet management.
- Manage Dero tokens and NFTs.
- Easily send payments and receive with QR code.
- Fast registration implemented (by pieswap).
- Keep list of contacts.
